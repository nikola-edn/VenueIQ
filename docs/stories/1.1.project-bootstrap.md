# Story 1.1: Project Bootstrap & MAUI Scaffolding

## Status
Implemented (awaiting build/test on MAUI host)

## Story
**As a** VenueIQ technical lead,
**I want** the initial repository and .NET MAUI project scaffolded with baseline configuration,
**so that** subsequent stories can build features on a consistent, standards-compliant foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Initialize a Git repository (or reuse existing) with MAUI solution named `VenueIQ` following source tree in `docs/architecture/9-source-tree.md`.
2. Configure .net 9 MAUI single-project template with required folders (Views, ViewModels, Services, Models, Resources, Platforms) and placeholder files listed in architecture doc.
3. Register dependency injection container in `MauiProgram.cs` with stub service & ViewModel registrations matching architecture (SettingsService, LocalizationService, etc.) using empty implementations where logic is pending.
4. Establish configuration scaffolding (App.xaml resources, AppShell navigation routes for Startup, Main, Settings) and verify app builds/runs on at least one target (Windows or Android emulator).
5. Create initial CI workflow (GitHub Actions or equivalent) that runs `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and placeholder test step for MAUI project.
6. Provide developer onboarding instructions in README (or docs/setup.md) describing prerequisites (`dotnet workload install maui`, platform SDKs) and basic run/test commands.
7. Include initial unit test project (e.g., `VenueIQ.Tests`) with passing placeholder test to validate pipeline wiring.
8. Establish baseline MAUI styles/resources (colors, typography, spacing, elevation) aligned with `docs/front-end-spec.md` and meeting WCAG AA contrast on default theme.
9. Ensure placeholder Startup, Main, and Settings pages follow the UX layout skeletons (header controls, content regions, safe area padding) and expose automation IDs called out in the UX spec for future UI tests.

  - [x] Add `VenueIQ.Tests` project with sample unit test referencing MAUI project (AC: 7)
  - [x] Ensure test project runs in CI workflow (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow coding standards in `docs/architecture/12-coding-standards-critical.md` when creating initial files.
- Align directory structure exactly with `docs/architecture/9-source-tree.md`; placeholder files should include comments referencing future stories.
- Stub services can throw `NotImplementedException` but maintain correct method signatures expected by later stories.
- Ensure MAUI workload requirements documented for Windows, macOS, and mobile targets; reference `docs/ui-architecture.md` for navigation shell expectations.
- CI pipeline should include matrix or comments for future platform builds; start with Windows runner configuration.
- Coordinate with `docs/front-end-spec.md` Sections 6-9 to mirror layout scaffolds, semantic structure, and component names; include comments pointing to spec anchors for developers.
- Provide base `SemanticProperties.Description` and `AutomationId` values called out in UX flows (e.g., `"Startup.ApiKeyEntry"`, `"Main.AnalyzeButton"`) so accessibility and UITest hooks remain consistent across stories.

### Testing
- Confirm `dotnet build` succeeds locally and via CI (AC: 5).
- Placeholder test (e.g., `SampleTests.cs`) should assert true and ensure test project integrated (AC: 7).
- Manual verification: run MAUI app to confirm navigation loads placeholder pages without runtime exceptions (AC: 4).
- Conduct quick accessibility smoke check using MAUI Accessibility Insights (or equivalent) to verify default color contrast and semantic tree for placeholder screens (AC: 8-9).

# Story 5.3: Serbian-First Labels & Localization Audit

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** Serbian-first VenueIQ user,
**I want** all UI labels, notifications, and exports to default to Serbian Latin with accurate translations,
**so that** the application feels native while still supporting English when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Conduct a localization audit ensuring every user-facing string (UI labels, toasts, dialog copy, export text, accessibility descriptions) is sourced from RESX resources with Serbian Latin default entries and English equivalents.
2. Main screen and exports must surface Serbian labels by default on fresh install, including map controls, badge captions, tooltips, and dialog buttons.
3. Add automated guard (e.g., static analysis script or unit test) that fails build when new hard-coded strings (non-localized) are introduced in XAML or C# sources.
4. Update localization documentation/copy deck listing resource keys, Serbian text, English translations, and context to support future updates.
5. Validate localization toggling (Story 1.4) covers new strings; ensure runtime switch updates all refreshed views without requiring restart.
6. Tests: run localization guard test, UI automation verifying Serbian defaults on clean profile, manual/automated verification toggling to English then back to Serbian with consistent translations.
7. Ensure UX copy tone/terminology aligns with Serbian-first guidance in `docs/front-end-spec.md#9-localization-guidelines` including capitalization, diacritics, and gendered language nuances for prompts and badges.
8. Provide accessible fallback text for strings that cannot be translated (e.g., third-party map controls) and document rationale in copy deck.
9. Extend localization audit to exports, tooltips, badges, and analytics events, ensuring resource keys include context metadata (`Description`, `Usage`) for translators.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Resource audit (AC: 1-2,4)
  - [ ] Inventory all strings in UI/export modules, migrate missing ones to RESX (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Update copy deck (docs/localization.md or similar) with keys/translations (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Capture tone/terminology notes per UX guideline and mark third-party exceptions (AC: 7-8)
- [ ] Localization enforcement (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement analyzer/script checking for hard-coded strings (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Integrate guard into CI pipeline (AC: 3)
- [ ] Runtime validation (AC: 2,5)
  - [ ] Ensure default culture set to `sr-Latn` on fresh start and applied to map/formatters (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Verify toggling updates new components via `LocalizationService` (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Confirm exports/tooltips use same resource keys and fallback paths (AC: 9)
- [ ] Testing (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add unit/integration tests for localization guard and runtime toggling (AC: 6)
  - [ ] UI automation verifying initial Serbian copy and toggle to English (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Document manual QA checklist for linguistic review (AC: 4,6)
  - [ ] Include regression suite verifying copy deck coverage (compare resource list vs doc) (AC: 4,7-9)

## Dev Notes
- Build on Story 1.4 implementation; this story ensures completeness across newly added UI (badges, tooltips, exports).
- Copy deck can live under `docs/localization.md`; coordinate with UX for final phrasing.
- For CI guard, consider Roslyn analyzer or regex script scanning for string literals outside resource usage; exclude logging strings if necessary.
- Ensure exports (Story 4.2) embed correct language fonts; double-check PDF templates load Serbian text properly.
- Align terminology for factor badges, tooltips, and export sections with approved Serbian glossary; includes abbreviations and units.
- Document fallback strategy for unlocalized third-party UI (e.g., map attributions) and provide translation notes.
- Plan periodic audit cadence (e.g., per release) so localization remains current; add reminder in copy deck.

### Testing
- Use `dotnet test` to run localization guard; optional additional static analysis step invoked via CI workflow created in Story 1.1.
- Manual QA should include verifying Serbian text quality with native speaker feedback.
- Manual localization review: check exports, tooltips, badges, analytics events, ensuring tone and diacritics match UX guidance.
